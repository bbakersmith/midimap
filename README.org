* MIDI Map
  A reasoned structure for mapping MIDI events to Clojure functions,
  presumably to execute side effects.

  *Very much a work in progress.*

  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (require '[midimap.core :as m])

  (def my-kit
    (m/kit 1
           (m/note 63 :default do-something)
           (m/note 64 :boolean do-something-else)))

  (def midi-event {:channel  1
                   :command  :note-on
                   :velocity 127
                   :note     63})

** Notes
  Notes contain an id, event handler, and optional args. They also define a
  protocol for processing a value for the event handler from note-on and
  note-off events.

*** Boolean

*** Default

*** Hex

*** Option

** Kits
  Kits are channel-specific and may contain any number of notes.

** Events
  MIDI events are processed at the kit level, which delegates down to
  matching channels and notes.
